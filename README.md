# NeoPixel Sound Visualizer

## Hardware

This is just the Hardware I use. You can use different controller, LEDs and so on, but you probably have to change the code a little bit.

* Adafruit Trinket 5V 8MHz
* Adafruit NeoPixel Ring /w 16x 5050 GRBW LEDs

For the MSGEQ7 effects you need:

* Any NeoPixel RGB(W) LED Strip
* An Arduino Uno
* 2x MSGEQ7
